# BookKeeper

BookKeeper is a low-level library you can use to implement more complicated double-entry accounting applications. It has a very basic chart of accounts and facilities for making journal entries, closing accounting periods and generating data structures suitable for creating an income statement and balance sheet. It's up to you to define a more compliex chart of accounts and implement the flows of money through the system.

## Blackground
You should have a basic knowledge of accounting to use BookKeeper. If you don't, start with the great [Accounting for Developers](http://subledger.com/how-to/) tutorials from the good folks at [subledger.com](http://subledger.com).

## Suitability
Don't use BookKeeper to manage real money. It's not thorougly tested and I'm not an accountant. If you're managing real money, try [SubLedger](http://subledger.com/).

*Note: I have no relationship with subledger at all. I just really like their tutorial.*

## Live Demo

## Chart of Accounts
The BookKeeper ChartOfAccounts object contains the following accounts by default:

|Name            |Normal Balance|
|----------------|--------------|
|assets          |Debit         |
|liabilities     |Credit        |
|equity          |Credit        |
|income          |Credit        |
|expenses        |Debit         |
|changesToEquity |Debit         |

Assets, liabilities and equity end up on the balance sheet. Income, expenses and changes equity (investments and withdrawl of profits) end up on the income statement.

## Period End
Prior to generating a period's financial statements you must close that period. Closing a period means:
1. All temporary accounts (income, expenses and changes to equity) must have a zero balance. This usually means a journal entry to transfer the balance to a balance sheet account.
2. No additional journal entries may be made for that period.

You need not provide a closing function. Bookkeeper has a built-in one that does the right thing with it's default accounts. However, the whole point of accounting is a more granular tracking of how money flows through your business so you probably want to provide your own closing function that meets your reporting needs.

## Roadmap
Bookkeepr does what I want it to, so I have no plans to develop it further in the near future. It could use dates in the journal entries that auto-map to some predefined periods though. A more thorough unit testing regime would also probably be a good idea. PRs welcome.

## Current State

Alpha. It seems to work but has somewhat sparse unit testing. Also, I'm not an accountant, so "seems to work" for me is not necessarily GAAP compliant.
